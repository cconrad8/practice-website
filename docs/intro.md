1. **Get a Synapse Account**: Start by creating a Synapse account.

2. **Navigate to Your Projects**: Once you have an account, you can access your projects. These projects are categorized into three types:
   - `Your Projects`: Projects created by you.
   - `Favorite Projects`: Projects you've marked as favorites.
   - `Team Projects`: Projects associated with your research team.

3. **Join a Research Team**: If you are part of a research team, the Data Coordination Center will create a team for your research, and you will be added to it.

4. **Access Shared Projects**: In the "Shared with Me" section, you can view projects that have been shared with you.

5. **Project Details**: When you click on a project, you will see project details at the top, including the project title and a unique Synapse ID.

6. **Project Information**: Within the project, you will find a Wiki file containing general information about the project. This can be customized to help organize and share project details.

7. **Make Data Public**: After the project is made public, you can upload your raw files. Typically, there is a folder called "data" where you can organize your data into subfolders corresponding to different research projects or studies.

These steps will help you navigate and manage your projects in Synapse.
