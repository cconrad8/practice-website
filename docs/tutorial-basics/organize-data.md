# Organizing Your Data

Project teams may have specialized data workflows based on their funded goals. These workflows can involve:

- Generating sequencing data and using various variant calling pipelines.
- Creating high-resolution images and extracting summary features from them.
- Combining different types of data.

During the onboarding process, it's essential to discuss the expected workflow, especially if it's complex or differs from the standard. Project teams should provide information or documentation about their specific workflow.

Data organization aligns with the processing stages. Data is structured in folders based on assay type and its processed category. Each top-level folder and its subfolders must contain data of the same type (see details below).

The Data Coordination Center (DCC) will create empty top-level folders and subfolders for the anticipated data levels. The structure depends on whether raw or processed data is expected. In some cases, only raw or processed data is anticipated. When only one data level is expected, everything is consolidated into a single folder without subfolders. Subfolders must match the data type and level of the parent folder they're contained in.

Example structure:

```plaintext
└── single_cell_RNA_seq
    ├── single_cell_RNA_seq_level1
        ├── fileA.fastq
        ├── fileB.fastq
        ├── fileC.fastq
        └── fileD.fastq
    ├── single_cell_RNA_seq_level2
        ├── fileA.bam
        ├── fileB.bam
        ├── fileC.bam
        └── fileD.bam
    ├── single_cell_RNA_seq_level3
        ├── raw_counts.txt
        ├── normalized_counts.txt
    ├── single_cell_RNA_seq_level4
        ├── t-SNE.txt
```
