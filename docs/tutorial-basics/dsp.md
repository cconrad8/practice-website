# Data Sharing Plan

## Gray Foundation Data Sharing Plan

## What is a Data Sharing Plan (DSP)?

One important component of a data sharing plan is to outline what datasets will be shared. 
We have a form that collects information focusing on this component. 
It is not as extensive as a plan described by [NIH policies](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-21-013.html), but is nevertheless used for the practical purpose of better data management.
By having a record of what to expect, the DCC can better plan storage, new application features, governance, and other infrastructure around the incoming data.

**EXAMPLE ONLY**: [generic blank data sharing plan](https://dsp-theta.vercel.app/dsp/preview)

## How to create or update your team DSP

Once onboarded, the team PI/data lead will receive a **special link** to access their specific versions, which will often contain information already on file. 
The DCC Data Manager will be the one sending the link when updates are needed to the data sharing plan.

## Phases of Data Sharing

The data sharing process for the Gray Foundation is divided into three distinct phases:

### 1. Private Phase

In this initial phase, data is accessible only to the Contributor and individuals authorized by the Contributor. This configuration serves as the default setting, unless specified otherwise by the grant. For example, certain pilot projects may commence in the Collaborative Sharing Phase.

### 2. Collaborative Sharing Phase

During the Collaborative Sharing Phase, curated data becomes available to investigators within the network.

### 3. Public Sharing Phase

In the Public Sharing Phase, data is made accessible to the broader research community while maintaining appropriate controls.

## Data Contribution Process

Significant governance activities take place even before data is generated or deposited into Synapse. The Data Coordination Center (DCC) engages in negotiations with each institution and requests detailed data sharing plans from data contributors. This information is essential for tailoring governance measures.

These efforts address several key questions:

- Where did the data originate, and which rules and regulations apply to it? (For instance, data from Europe is subject to GDPR rules.)

- What are the data's origins, and which policies should be followed accordingly?

- What rules should be adhered to based on the preferences of data contributors?

- Does the data contain sensitive or personal information?

- Have we obtained proper consent from patients to use their data?

- Is the sharing of human data in compliance with HIPAA's privacy guidelines?
