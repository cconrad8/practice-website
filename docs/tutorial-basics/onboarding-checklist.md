# Onboarding Checklist

**ðŸ‘‹ We welcome new teams/new staff with an overview that covers the Gray Foundation Data Coordination Center and what setup is needed.** 
   
 **New Teams Webinar**
   _All personnel (PI, researchers, staff, project managers, etc) are encouraged to attend a "New Teams Webinar hosted by Sage Bionetworks/DCC._

   The objective of this 1-hour webinar is to: 
- Provide a face-to-face introduction to the DCC staff including Sage Bionetworks and MSKCC
- Review the "Onboarding Checklist"
- Introduce teams to open-science data storage and analysis tools (ie. Synapse and cBioportal)
- Discuss potential data sharing goals and brain storm data-reusability and analysis opportunities
- Inform teams of opportunities to join working groups (i.e. the analysis working group) and collaborate with other Gray Foundation researchers

### New Teams Onboarding Checklist 
   
#### For Principal Investigators: 
- [ ] Designate at least one data lead contact for team. (_There may be multiple data lead(s) because there are multiple individuals responsible for different data types._)
- [ ] Create a certified account on the Synapse platform. 
- [ ] Complete a data sharing plan.
- [ ] Review and approve your public profile on documentation site and Synapse
- [ ] Send name/email address/role of key personnel to the DCC.
- [ ] Finalize governance/data sharing policy plans
- [ ] (Optional) Join the Gray Foundation Slack workspace.

#### For data leads and contributors:
- [ ] Confirm review of documentation and forward any questions or concerns to be addressed early on. 
- [ ] Decide a preferred touchbase baseline schedule and medium (e.g. quarterly over videochat or monthly over email).
- [ ] Create certified accounts on the Synapse platform.
- [ ] Confirm that they have been added with appropriate team access permissions on the platform.
- [ ] (Optional) Get more interactive training on Synapse platform. This is recommended if data lead(s) have never used Synapse or a similar platform and are not comfortable with usage based solely upon the documentation.  
- [ ] (Optional, upon request) Get more interactive training of the clinical data and metadata intake process. This is recommended if data lead(s) are not comfortable with usage based solely upon the documentation.  
- [ ] (Optional) Join the Gray Foundation Slack workspace.

### Supplemental Onboarding

Onboarding is available for new personnel and are designated data lead(s) after a project has been started. 
Please contact the DCC if you as soon as the DCC is aware of the new personnel relevant to the project, we will reach out with onboarding interactions and steps adapted from the above; this can be more flexible because there may already have been some knowledge transfer.
