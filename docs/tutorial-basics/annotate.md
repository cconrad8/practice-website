## File-level Metadata

For each uploaded data file, assay-specific metadata is collected. It's important to note that the metadata required for sequencing .fastq files in a sequencing assay may differ significantly from the metadata needed for .tiff files in an imaging assay. To accommodate these variations, we provide distinct metadata templates for each data type.

Furthermore, even within the same assay, different processing levels may demand different metadata templates. For example, "raw" sequencing .fastq data from RNA-seq requires somewhat different annotations compared to the summarized expression data.

Our data-level concept is closely aligned with the Genomics Data Commons data levels, ensuring consistency and clarity.

## Dataset-level Metadata

Files are organized and shared as datasets, which simplify data management and access. When your project is ready to release the data, typically after a paper has been published, the dataset is published and cataloged in our portal.

## Metadata Templates

After uploading data, contributors can find those files on our [Data Curator App](https://dca.app.sagebionetworks.org/), which is used to help annotate the data. Select **Gray Foundation**, your project name, and the folder of files you want to annotate. Then select a metadata template.

We offer a variety of metadata templates tailored to different data types and assays. Here's a list of some commonly used templates:

- Imaging Metadata Template
- Patient Data Metadata Template
- RNA Sequencing Metadata Template

These templates ensure that your data is well-documented and organized, making it easier for you to manage and share your research.
