# Applying Metadata to Data


After uploading data, contributors can find those files on our [Data Curator App](https://dca.app.sagebionetworks.org/), which is used to help annotate the data. Select **Gray Foundation**, your project name, and the folder of files you want to annotate. Then select a metadata template.
Click download template and go through the steps of populating the template. Export the template as a .csv and reupload it to the data curator app and validate. After it passes validation, you may submit it and your annotations will now appear on Synapse with your data.

We offer a variety of metadata templates tailored to different data types and assays. 

Here's are examples of the google sheets that are generated for common assays:

- [Imaging Level 2 Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1SoGrRLRmKFUjk4hj4YMJKi-9zeiAKm1XIfqjYa9Q6iA/edit)
- [Patient Data Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mawAq6MiSiGfHa6ezEfCir0MVXZCxd3atZvVgE_ZOiM/edit)
- [Single Cell RNA Sequencing Level 1 Metadata Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cpiZn6vnehpYaLoi8ponTrDHxqoGIXXEjXqiWpaHSfg/edit#gid=0)

These templates ensure that your data is well-documented and organized, making it easier for you to manage and share your research.
