#### Principal Investigators:

- [ ] Designate at least one data lead contact for the team. _(Note: Multiple data leads are possible if responsible for different data types.)_

#### Data Leads and Contributors:

- [ ] Confirm the review of documentation and forward any questions or concerns for early resolution.
- [ ] Determine a preferred touchbase schedule and medium (e.g., quarterly over video chat or monthly over email).
- [ ] Create certified accounts on the Synapse platform.
- [ ] Confirm that appropriate team access permissions are granted on the platform.
- [ ] (Optional) Seek more interactive training on the Synapse platform, especially if not comfortable with usage based solely on documentation.
- [ ] (Optional, upon request) Receive additional interactive training on the clinical data and metadata intake process, recommended for those not comfortable with usage based solely on documentation.
- [ ] (Optional) Join the Gray Foundation Slack workspace.

#### Supplemental Onboarding:

Onboarding is available for new personnel designated as data leads after a project has started. Please contact the DCC as soon as new personnel relevant to the project are identified. The DCC will reach out with onboarding interactions and steps adapted from the above. This process can be more flexible due to potential prior knowledge transfer.
