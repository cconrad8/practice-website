_All project members, including PIs, researchers, staff, and project managers, are strongly encouraged to participate in the "New Teams Webinar hosted by Sage Bionetworks/DCC."_

The primary objectives of this 1-hour webinar are as follows:
- Offer a face-to-face introduction to the DCC staff, which includes representatives from Sage Bionetworks and MSKCC.
- Discuss and go over the "Onboarding Checklist."
- Familiarize teams with open-science data storage and analysis tools, such as Synapse and cBioportal.
- Explore potential data sharing goals and brainstorm opportunities for data reusability and analysis.
- Inform teams about opportunities to join working groups, such as the analysis working group, and foster collaboration with other Gray Foundation researchers.
