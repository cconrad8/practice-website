# Data Analysis

Processed data are made available on some of the most well-known applications.
This brings data to a bigger stage for collaboration, analysis, and more impactful data sharing. 
The data can be distributed on multiple apps specialized for the data type, and the **Gray Foundation Portal** will be the entrypoint for all of these. 

MSKCC can also work on development or customizations of apps/tools for a particular data type if needed. 
However, not all data may be available for analysis -- whether data is "elevated" to an analysis appp depends prioritization and suitability. 

Below, we provide more details on analysis apps and which data types are targeted for them. 

## cBioPortal

The [cBioPortal](https://docs.cbioportal.org/) for Cancer Genomics was originally developed at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) for sharing genomic data. We provide a custom instance for the Gray Foundation. The available data includes:

- Copy Number Variation (CNV)
- Summarized gene expression (RNA-seq)
- Mutations

## CELLxGENE

[CELLxGENE](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/cellxgene) ("cell-by-gene") is an interactive data explorer specifically designed for analyzing single-cell datasets.

- Single-cell RNA-sequencing data

## Minerva Viewer

- CyCIF imaging data
