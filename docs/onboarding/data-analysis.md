# Data Analysis

Processed data are made available on some of the most well-known applications.
This brings data to a bigger stage for collaboration, analysis, and more impactful data sharing. 
The data can be distributed on multiple apps specialized for the data type, and the **Gray Foundation Portal** will be the entrypoint for all of these. 

MSKCC can also work on development or customizations of apps/tools for a particular data type if needed. 
However, not all data may be available for analysis -- whether data is "elevated" to an analysis appp depends prioritization and suitability. 

Below, we provide more details on analysis apps and which data types are targeted for them.

| Data Type                             | Analysis App      |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Copy Number Variation (CNV)          | cbioportal        |
| Summarized Gene Expression (RNA-seq) | cbioportal        |
| Mutations                             | cbioportal        |
| Single Cell RNA Sequencing Data      | CellXGene         |
| CyCIF Imaging Data                    | Minerva Viewer    |
